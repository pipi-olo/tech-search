# Welcome to Tech Search Docs

The tech-search project is a vibe-coding based project. Tech-Search Docs is a repository for managing the SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for vibe-coding.
It manages various documents such as overall architecture, common conventions and API specifications for each service in one place.

## Project Rules
* All code be written via vibe-coding using GitHub Copilot.
* Files used by GitHub Copilot are centrally managed in the `tech-search-docs` repository.
  * Each service must reference the `tech-search-docs/.github` folder via a symbolic link.
